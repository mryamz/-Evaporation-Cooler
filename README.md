# -Evaporation-Cooler
• In dry, hot climates, evaporation coolers provide a more energy efficient alternative to air conditioners • Air is pulled in from the outside through a pad that is soaked in water. • The evaporation of the water cools and humidifies the air • They are not recommended for environments where the air is humid
